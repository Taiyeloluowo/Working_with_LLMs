## DEEP LEARNING

**What is Deep Learning?**

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where algorithms learn from vast amounts of data using ***neural networks***, which are inspired by the ***human brain***.

It is called **deep** becuase the neural networks have many layers, wwhich helps in understanding complex patterns in data.

Neural networks are composed of ***layers of nodes*** (also known as neurons), each layer transforming the data before passing it on to the next layer.

**Neural Networks**

A neural network consists of three types of layers:

1. **Input layer**: Receives the data(image,videos,text, numbers)
2. **Hidden layers**: Intermediate layers that process the data.This is where the learning happens by transforming the inputs. The more the hidden layers, the deeper the networks.
3. **Output layer**: Produces the final prediction.

**How Does Neural Network Learn?**

The network learns by adjsting weights(parameters) and biases as it processes data through these layers.

**How Does the Neurons Work**
* Each neurons performs a mathematical operation;
1. Takes in input, and each input is multiplied by a wieght.
2. It adds up all of the weighted inputs.
3. Applies an activation function, that is, deciding if the neuron should pass a signal forward or now.
4. Then passesthe output to the next layer.
