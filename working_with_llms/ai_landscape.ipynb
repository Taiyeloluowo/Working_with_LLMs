    "## Part 1: Understanding the AI Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Artificial Intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think about this:** When you use Google Maps to navigate from Ikeja to Abeokuta, and it tells you \"there's heavy traffic on the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway, take an alternative route\" - is that intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pause and think...*\n",
    "\n",
    "YES - it's artificial intelligence. Google Maps hasn't been programmed with rules like \"if time > 8am, then traffic = heavy\". Instead, it **learned patterns** from millions of trips to predict traffic it has never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fundamental difference between traditional programming and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional programming:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "if customer_age >= 18:\n",
    "    allow_account_creation()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    reject_account_creation()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You write explicit rules. The computer follows them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But here's a question:** How would you write rules to identify whether a photo contains jollof rice or fried rice?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Think about it...*\n",
    "\n",
    "You might say \"if the rice is red, it's jollof\" - but what about party jollof that's darker? Fried rice with tomatoes? Photos in dim light? You'd need thousands of rules and still miss cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning approach:**\n",
    "1. Provide examples (photos labeled \"jollof\" or \"fried rice\")\n",
    "2. Algorithm finds patterns (colors, textures, shapes)\n",
    "3. Model learns rules automatically\n",
    "4. It identifies new photos it has never seen\n",
    "\n",
    "**The paradigm shift: From rule-based to pattern-learned systems.**\n",

    "### Real Example: Lagos Traffic Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional approach:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "if time == \"morning_rush\":\n",
    "    travel_time = 3.5 hours\n",
    "elif time == \"afternoon\":\n",
    "    travel_time = 2 hours\n",
    "elif day == \"friday_evening\":\n",
    "    travel_time = 4 hours\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** What about holidays? Festivals? Weather? Accidents? You'd need infinite rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML approach:**\n",
    "1. Collect data: thousands of trips with time, day, weather, actual duration\n",
    "2. Feed to ML algorithm\n",
    "3. Algorithm learns complex patterns automatically\n",
    "4. Predicts new situations it never saw before\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways from Part 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI** is the broad field; **ML** learns from data; **Deep Learning** uses neural networks; **Generative AI** creates content\n",
    "2. **The shift:** From writing rules → to learning patterns from data\n",
    "3. ML finds complex patterns impossible to code manually\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: The Three Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised Learning: Learning with a Teacher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Learning Nigerian currencies as a child - your parent shows you notes and says \"This is 1000 naira.\" After many examples, you can identify any note.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Provide input data WITH correct answers (labels)\n",
    "- Algorithm learns the relationship\n",
    "- Predicts outputs for new inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Spam filter:** Email content → Spam or Not Spam\n",
    "- **Lekki house prices:** Bedrooms, size, location → Price (₦50M, ₦120M)\n",
    "- **Loan default:** Income, history, employment → Will default? (Yes/No)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Real Nigerian Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Banking**\n",
    "- Photos of fake/real naira notes → **“Real” or “Fake”**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agriculture**\n",
    "- Photos of yam → **“Good yam” or “Spoilt yam”**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Health**\n",
    "- Temperature + symptoms → **“Malaria” or “Not malaria”**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transportation**\n",
    "- Car features → **Predict sale price for Tokunbo cars**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding Hidden Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Observing Balogun Market shoppers without labels. You discover patterns: \"Some only buy electronics,\" \"Some haggle and buy bulk,\" \"Some browse but rarely buy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Provide input data WITHOUT labels\n",
    "- Algorithm finds hidden structure\n",
    "- Discovers relationships you didn't know existed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Customer segmentation:** Purchase history → Groups (\"fashion enthusiasts,\" \"bargain hunters\")\n",
    "- **Fraud detection:** Transaction patterns → Flag unusual behavior\n",
    "- **Netflix categories:** Movie features → Natural groupings (without manual labeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Real Nigerian Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bank**\n",
    "- Group customers by spending habits (not pre-labeled)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supermarket**\n",
    "- Finds items people usually buy together  \n",
    "  *(e.g., Indomie + eggs + pepper)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Music App**\n",
    "- Groups songs by vibe automatically  \n",
    "  *(chill, gospel, street vibes, amapiano)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agriculture**\n",
    "- Group farms by soil quality or crop type  \n",
    "  *(no labels needed)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reinforcement Learning: Trial and Error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Learning to drive in Lagos. No manual says \"if car approaches at 50km/h, turn right at 15 degrees.\" You try actions, get feedback (smooth drive = good; almost crash = bad), and learn over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Agent takes actions in environment\n",
    "- Each action gets reward (positive or negative)\n",
    "- Learns strategy that maximizes rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **Game AI:** Try moves → Win/lose → Learn winning strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 Game Playing   \n",
    "Agent: AI player   \n",
    "Environment: The game (e.g., Chess, Super Mario)   \n",
    "Action: Moves it makes   \n",
    "Reward: Win (+1), Lose (–1)   \n",
    "\n",
    "→ It plays many times and learns which moves lead to winning.\n",
    "- **Social media feed:** Show content → User engages/leaves → Learn what keeps users engaged\n",
    "- **Delivery routing:** Try routes → Fast/slow delivery → Learn optimal paths\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Real Nigerian Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bolt/Uber Driver App**\n",
    "- App tests different routes and learns which gets you there fastest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mobile Network Towers**\n",
    "- System tries different signal allocations → chooses the best for speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trading Bots**\n",
    "- Try buying/selling → learn which strategies make profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robots on a Farm**\n",
    "- Try different paths → learn the fastest way to water crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Football Simulation Game**\n",
    "- AI players try dribbling, passing → learn strategies that score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Type for Which Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised:** You have labeled data and want specific predictions  \n",
    "**Unsupervised:** You have data but no labels, want to discover structure  \n",
    "**Reinforcement:** You have a goal, can try actions and get feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways from Part 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised** = labeled examples (most common for Gen AI)\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised** = find patterns without labels\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement** = learn from rewards/punishments\n",
    "4. Different problems need different approaches\n",
